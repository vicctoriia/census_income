## Feature engineering - Census Income 

This project was inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0u6bxQOUJ8).The dataset is available [here](https://github.com/aprilypchen/depy2016/blob/master/adult.csv)  from the speaker! 


The dataset is quite famous and you can find all its details [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). **Its initial goal was to identify according to the available variables whether or not a person earns more than 50k per year!**
